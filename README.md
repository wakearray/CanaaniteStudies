# A Collection of TiddlyWikis To Organize My Thoughts

<strong>CanaaniteStudies</strong> is a collection of my thoughts as I learn more about the ancient religious roots our culture is based on, largely focusing on the ancient Canaanite version of the Ugaritic semetic religion and it's impact on the Old Testament.
